- Three core principles
  - Confidentiality:
  - Integrity:
  - Availability: TCP/IP, and www, TCP - SYN, SYN/ACK
    - [Stateful Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateful_firewall)

Security
- Availability
- Confidentiality
- Privacy
- Integrity

What is The Sandbox do?
- A sandbox is an isolated testing environment that enables users to run programs or open files without affecting the application, system or platform on which they run. 
- Software developers use sandboxes to test new programming code. 
- Cybersecurity professionals use sandboxes to test potentially malicious software.

- Steps
  - Define protect surface: Data, Applications, Assets, Services
  - Map transaction flows
  - Arquitect Zero Trust Network
  - Create Zero Trust policy
  - Monitor and maintain network

- Primary Tenets of Zero Trust
  - Explicit verification
    - Alltid verifiser
  - Least provileged access
    - Gi minst mulig tilgang (least Privelige)
  - Assue breach
    - Du er allerede infisert

- Viktig punkter
  - offentlige forvaltningsorganer
  - identitetstyveri (credentials)
  - misconfigured Cloud
    - kubernets - devops - Azure - osv
  - datadrevet virksomhet

- Application
  - input: suspicion of malicious
  - output: unauthorized
  - Use APIs to track access

Policy
- Policy Decision Point
- Access data resources via APIs
- Policy Engine Platforms

- Service providers is an individual or entity that provides services to another party
  - Microsoft
  - Google

Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) vs VPN
- Single package authorization
- 80% of security breaches are internal
- The rise fo Phishing attacks
- One identity Provider To Rule Them All 

What is a gateway in Internet? 
- A computer that sits between different networks or applications. 
- The gateway converts information, data or other communications from one protocol or format to another. 
- A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway.
- A gateway serves as a single access point and a converter to connect dissimilar networks using different protocols.
- A router sets the shortest path for the data packets to travel from source to destination.
- A gateway is a node (router) in a computer network.
- The gateway works like a portal among two programs by means of communications between protocol and permit them to share data on same computers or among different computers. 
- Gateways are also known as protocol converter that can perform at nay OSI model layer.
- There are two main types of gateways: unidirectional gateways and bidirectional gateways.
- The Wireless Gateway acts as a modem (connection to the Internet) and a router (connecting multiple devices within the home). 
- While it's not necessary, you can choose to have a separate router to create the home network in addition to your Wireless Gateway.

Patch management 
- PM is the practice of deploying firmware, driver, operating system (OS), and application updates to your computing endpoints. 
- PM is critical to keeping systems updated, reducing attack surfaces, and ensuring employee productivity.
