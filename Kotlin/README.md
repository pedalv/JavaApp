# [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- For Java programmers wanting to be prepared for future project.
- For Android app developer who knows Java well, but we want to be able to move forward with Kotlin for new Android development work.

# What is Kotlin? 
- Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. 
- Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. 
- Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code (via LLVM). 
- Kotlin is sponsored by JetBrains and Google through the Kotlin Foundation.
- Kotlin is officially supported by Google for mobile development on Android.
- Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin is included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. 
- The Android Kotlin compiler lets the user choose between targeting Java 6 or Java 8 compatible bytecode.

# What is Kotlin for?
- Development lead [Andrey Breslav](https://sites.google.com/site/abreslav/about/) has said that Kotlin is designed to be an industrial-strength object-oriented language, and a "better language" than Java, but still be fully interoperable with Java code, allowing companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin

# [Kotlin history (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language))
- In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled Project Kotlin, a new language for the JVM, which had been under development for a year.
- JetBrains lead Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. 
- However, he cited the slow compilation time of Scala as a deficiency.
- One of the stated goals of Kotlin is to compile as quickly as Java. 

- In February 2012, JetBrains open sourced the project under the Apache 2 license.

- The name comes from Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. 
- Andrey Breslav mentioned that the team decided to name it after an island just like Java was named after the Indonesian island of Java (though the programming language Java was perhaps named after the coffee).

- JetBrains hopes that the new language will drive IntelliJ IDEA sales.

- Kotlin v1.0 was released on February 15, 2016.
- This is considered to be the first officially stable release and JetBrains has committed to long-term backwards compatibility starting with this version.

- At Google I/O 2017, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android.
- Kotlin v1.2 was released on November 28, 2017.
- Sharing code between JVM and Javascript platforms feature was newly added to this release.
- Kotlin v1.3 was released on October 29, 2018, bringing coroutines for asynchronous programming.

- Kotlin 1.3.40 released
