# Oracle Certified Professional (OCP)

> Solid understanding of Java, and some of its SE APIs, and is a prerequisite to a number of the other Java certificates

> It is designed as a fairly detailed test of knowledge of the core features and constructs of the Java programming language. 

> It tests a wide range of Java's APIs, and core features, starting from basics such as looping constructs, and variables, to more complex topics such as Threads, Collections and Generics. 

> It does not cover specific technology domains such as GUI creation, Web or network programming, though it does cover part of the APIs included in the standard library. 

> The exam tests how well a programmer has understood the language constructs and mechanisms.

> The chapters are organized as follows:

- Chapter 1: Advanced Class Design This chapter covers inheritance, including abstract
classes and the final keyword. It also discusses inner classes and enums.

- Chapter 2: Design Patterns and Principles This chapter teaches you best practices for
designing and writing applications that lead to code that is easier to understand and more
maintainable.

- Chapter 3: Generics and Collections This chapter goes beyond ArrayList and shows
Sets, Maps, and Queues. It also shows new methods in Java 8 on these classes.

- Chapter 4: Functional Programming This chapter explains lambdas and stream pipelines
in detail. It also covers the built-in functional interfaces and the Optional class.

- Chapter 5: Dates, Strings, and Localization This chapter shows the improved date and
time classes in Java 8. It also covers more advanced String concepts that you need to know
and how to make your application work in multiple languages.

- Chapter 6: Exceptions and Assertions This chapter shows more advanced syntax for
exceptions than what appears on the OCA. It also covers how to use assertions to verify the
state of your program.

- Chapter 7 : Concurrency This chapter introduces the concept of thread management, and
it teaches you how to write multi-threaded programs using the Concurrency API.

- Chapter 8 : IO This chapter introduces you to managing fi les and directories using the
java.io API. It also instructs you on how to read and write fi le data using I/O streams.

- Chapter 9 : NIO.2 This chapter shows you how to manage fi les and directories using the
newer NIO.2 API. It includes techniques for reading and writing fi le attributes, as well as
traversing and searching for fi les using lambdas and streams.

- Chapter 10 : JDBC This chapter provides the basics of working with databases in Java
including different types of ResultSet s.

- Appendix A: Answers to Review Questions This appendix lists the answers to the Review
Questions along with explanations.

- Appendix B: Study Tips This appendix covers how to approach studying for the exam.

> The early chapters define 

- the building blocks of Java 8, 

> while the later chapters 

- present commonly used Java 8 frameworks.

## Om Exam

> It is assessed through 

- an automatically administered multiple-choice test system. 

- The test consists of multiple choice questions. 

- The test is available in English, Japanese, Chinese, German, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.

- In June 2011, Oracle moved from Prometric to Pearson VUE as their test provider.

- and consists of 60 questions.

- which the candidate has 150 minutes to answer.

- At least 37 questions are needed to be correct to pass (around 61%).

- To take the test a candidate must buy a voucher from Oracle (approximately US$300 in the US, Â£150 (excluding VAT) in the UK, AUD 316 plus tax in Australia, Rs. 8000 plus taxes in India) and book the test at least a week in advance.

## The OCPJP 6 exam 

> tests a candidate on knowledge of 

- declarations, 

- access control, 

- object orientation, 

- assignments, 

- operators, 

- flow control, 

- assertions, 

- string handling, 

- I/O, 

- parsing, 

- formatting, 

- generics, 

- collections, 

- inner classes, 

- threads 

- and the JDK tools.


## The OCPJP 7 exam 

> includes a few new Java 7 features such as 

- NIO 2, 

- try-with-resources, 

- catching multiple exceptions, 

- and fork/join framework.

> The OCPJP 7 exam has 

- 90 questions 

- and one has to answer 65% of the questions to clear it. 

## If you have an older version of Java Programmer certification 

> (such as SCJP/OCPJP 6), you can take the upgrade exam (1Z0-805) to get your OCPJP 7.

> You have to know this topic as well as you knew loops on the OCA exam:

- Java 8 lambdas 

- and functional programming streams

- Chapter 2 reviews functional interfaces 

- and Chapter 3 introduces method references

- Chapter 4 covers the Streams API in detail
