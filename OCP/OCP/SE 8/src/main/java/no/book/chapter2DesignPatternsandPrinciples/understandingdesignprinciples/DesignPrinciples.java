/*
A design principle is an established idea or best practice that facilitates the software design
    process. In general, following good design principles leads to
■ More logical code
■ Code that is easier to understand
■ Classes that are easier to reuse in other relationships and applications
■ Code that is easier to maintain and that adapts more readily to changes in the
    application requirements
we will refer to the decision of how to structure class relationships as the underlying data model.
In software development, a data model is the representation of our objects and their properties within
our application and how they relate to items in the real world.
