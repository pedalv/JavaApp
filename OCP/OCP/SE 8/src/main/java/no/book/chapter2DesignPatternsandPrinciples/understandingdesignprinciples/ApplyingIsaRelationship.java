/*
the Is‐a Relationship could be used to determine when an object is an instance of a particular class,
    superclass, or interface.
In object‐oriented design, we describe the property of an object being an instance
    of a data type as having an is‐a relationship.
The is‐a relationship is also known as the inheritance test.
The fundamental result of the is‐a principle is that if A is‐a B, then any instance of A can
    be treated like an instance of B.
This holds true for a child that is a subclass of any parent, be it a direct subclass or a distant child.
As we discussed with polymorphism, objects can take many different forms.
When constructing an inheritance‐based data model, it is important to apply the is‐a relationship regularly,
   so that you are designing classes that conceptually make sense.
