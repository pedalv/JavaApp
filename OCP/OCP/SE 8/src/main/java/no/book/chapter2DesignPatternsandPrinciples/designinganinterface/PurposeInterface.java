    /*
    An interface provides a way for one individual to develop code that uses another
        individual’s code, without having access to the other individual’s underlying
        implementation.
    Interfaces can facilitate rapid application development by enabling
        development teams to create applications in parallel,
        rather than being directly dependent on each other.
    For example, two teams can work together to develop a one‐page standard interface
        at the start of a project.
    One team then develops code that uses the interfaces while the
        other team develops code that implements the interface.
    The development teams can then combine their implementations toward the end of the project,
        and as long as both teams developed with the same interface,
        they will be compatible.
Of course, testing will still be required to make sure that the class implementing
the interface behaves as expected.
