/*
Legacy code is older code.
It is usually code that is in a different style than you would write if you were writing the code today.
In this section,
    we are referring to code that was written to target Java 1.4 or lower,
    and therefore it does not use generics.
Collections written without generics are also known as raw collections.
Remember that using generics gives us compile time safety.
At least it does when all of the code involved uses generics.
When some code uses generics and other code does not,
    it is easy to get lulled into a false sense of security.
