    Finally, all constructors in a singleton class are marked private,
    which ensures that no other class is capable of instantiating another version of the class.
    By marking the constructors private, we have implicitly marked the class final.
    Recall that every class requires at least one constructor, with the default no‚Äêargument constructor
        being added if none are provided.
    Furthermore, the first line of any constructor is a call to a parent constructor with the super() command.
        If all of the constructors are declared private in the singleton class,
        then it is impossible to create a subclass with a valid constructor;
        therefore, the singleton class is effectively final.
