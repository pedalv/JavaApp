    /*
    Generics and Collections
■■ Create and use a generic class
■■ Create and use ArrayList, TreeSet, TreeMap and ArrayDeque objects
- This includes other lists, sets, queues, and maps.
- The thread-safe collection types will be discussed in Chapter 7, “Concurrency.”
- The Java Collections Framework includes classes that implement
  List,
  Map,
  Queue,
  and Set.
- The class ArrayList implements the interface List.
- You also saw arrays on the OCA, such as int[]. An array is not part of the Collections Framework.
Since sorting and searching are similar between lists and arrays, both are covered on the exam.
- In the following sections, we will review
  arrays,
  ArrayLists,
  wrapper classes,
  autoboxing,
  the diamond operator,
  searching,
  and sorting.
■■ Use java.util.Comparator and java.lang.Comparable interfaces
- You’ll learn how to customize searching and sorting using Comparable and Comparator.
■■ Iterate using forEach methods on Streams and List
- We will end with some methods that use functional interfaces, such as forEach() and merge().
■■ Use method references with Streams
✓✓ Advanced Java Class Design
- we will cover the Stream API.
■■ Create and use lambda expressions
✓✓ Generics and Collections
- Note that the exam objectives are sloppy and sometimes use “stream” to include “stream” and “lambda.”
■■ Filter a collection using lambda expressions
✓✓ Java Stream API
■■ Use of merge()and flatMap()methods of the Stream API
- The merge() method is on Map and not really a stream API.
