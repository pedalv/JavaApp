/*
A nested class is a class that is defined within another class.
A nested class that is not static is called an inner class.
There are four of types of nested classes:
■■ A member inner class is a class defined at the same level as instance variables.
    It is not static.
    Often, this is just referred to as an inner class without explicitly saying the type.
■■ A local inner class is defined within a method.
■■ An anonymous inner class is a special case of a local inner class that does not have a name.
■■ A static nested class is a static class that is defined at the same level as static variables.

There are a few benefits of using inner classes.
They can encapsulate helper classes by restricting them to the containing class.
They can make it easy to create a class that will be used in only one place.
They can make the code easier to read.
They can also make the code harder to read when used improperly.
