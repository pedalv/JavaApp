    Be able to write code that declares, implements, and/or extends interfaces.
    An interface is like an abstract class that defines a set of
        public abstract methods,
        which classes implementing the interface must provide.
    A class may implement multiple interfaces as well as extend classes that implement interfaces,
        allowing for limited multiple inheritance in Java.
    Interfaces may extend other interfaces,
        although they may not extend a class and vice versa.
    Interfaces may also contain
        public static final constant values,
        public static methods,
        and public default methods.c
