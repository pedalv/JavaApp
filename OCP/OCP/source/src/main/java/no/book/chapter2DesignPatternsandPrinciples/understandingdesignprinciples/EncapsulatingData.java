/*
In software development, encapsulation is the idea of combining fields and methods in
    a class such that the methods operate on the data, as opposed to the users of the class
    accessing the fields directly.
In Java, it is commonly implemented with private instance members that have public methods to retrieve
    or modify the data, commonly referred to as getters and setters, respectively.
The underlying idea of encapsulation is that no actor other than the class itself should have direct access to its data.
The class is said to encapsulate the data it contains and prevent anyone from directly accessing it.
With encapsulation, a class is able to maintain certain invariants about its internal data.
An invariant is a property or truth that is maintained even after the data is modified.
 */
public class EncapsulatingData {

    public static void main(String ... args) {
        Animal a1 = new Animal("Dog");
        a1.setAge(10);
        //a1.setAge(-10);
        /*
        Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Age cannot be a negative number
         */

        //Animal a2 = new Animal("");
        //Animal a3 = new Animal(null);
        /*
        Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Species is required
         */
    }

}

/*
As you can see in this example, species and age are both marked private,
    with public methods getSpecies() and getAge() to read the data.
Next, our setSpecies() and setAge() methods now validate the input and throw an exception if one of our
    invariants is violated.
Finally, a non‚Äêdefault constructor has been added that requires a species value
    and uses the setter method to validate the input.
The advantage of this new implementation of the Animal class is that it uses encapsulation
to enforce the design principles of the class.
Anytime an instance of an Animal object is passed to a method,
    it can be used without requiring that its invariants be validated.
