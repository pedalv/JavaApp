        % can be user on integral types and on floating points.
        5.5%3 = 2.5
        Integral types means byte, short, int, long and chart
        floating points operands

        & can have integral as well as boolean operands.
        & if used on boolen parameters

    && ! \\ operate only on booleans

    "til" operates only on integral types: byte, short, int, long, and char

    The types of the Java programming language are divided
    into two categories:
    1. primitive types,
     are the:
     1.1 boolean type and
     1.2 the numeric types,
      it is the integral types: byte, short, int, long, char, and
      the floating point types: float and double
    2. reference types
    are class types, interface types, and array types.
    2.1 there is also a special null type
    2.2 An object is a dynamically created instance of a class type or a dynamically created array
    The values of a reference type are references to objects.
    All objects, including arrays, support the methods of class Object.
    String literal are represented by String objects.
