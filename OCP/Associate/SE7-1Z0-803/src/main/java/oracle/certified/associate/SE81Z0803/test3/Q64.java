    1.static and final
    are valid modifiers for both member field and method
    declarations within a class

    2. transient and volatile modifiers
    are only valid for member field declarations

    3. abstract and natide
    are only valid for member methods

    Note
    1. a class declaration can have only
    final, abstract and public as modifiers,
    unless it is a nested class,
    in which case,
    it can be declared private or protected as well
    2. within a method,
    a local variable may be declared as final
