/*
    - a method in an interface cannot be declared:
    native
    or
    synchronized
    or a compile-time error occurs,
    because those keywords describe implementations properties
    rather then interface properties.
    However, a method declared in an interface may be implemented
    by a method that is declared native or synchronized in a class that
     implements the interface.
