    A standalone program - is a computer program that does not
    load any external module, library function, or program and
    that is designed to boot with the bootstrap procedure of
    the target processor.

    Standalone programs are usually written in or complied to
    the assembly language for the specific hardware.

    Standalone programs were the only way to run a computer.

    Most computers until the mid-1950s, and later still embedded
    processors.

    Nowadays, standalone programs are a nearly extinct species
    of programs. Even the most basic processors these days have
    sufficient storage to allow the operating system overhead,
    and if this is still a problem, basic general purpose
    operating systems are available for that purpose.
    E.g. in the diskette era, apparently standalone utility
    programs were delivered with a basic version of DOS fitting
    onto the same diskette.
