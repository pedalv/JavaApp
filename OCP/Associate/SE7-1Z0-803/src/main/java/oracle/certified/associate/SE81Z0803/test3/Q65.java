    /*
    Statements about interfaces:

    1. Interfaces do not contain any imlementations and
    only permit multiplr interface inheritance

    2. unlike a class, an interface can extend from multiple
    interfaces. An interface can extend any number of other
    interfaces and can be extended by any number of other interface.

    3. methods of an interface are public and non-static. method
    prototypes in interfaces vÂ´an never be static

    4. fields are public, static and final. variables in
    interface are always static
