    /*
    There are numerous rules associated with implementing interfaces that you should know
    quite well at this point.
For example,
    interfaces cannot extend classes,
    nor can classes extend interfaces.
Interfaces may also not be marked final or instantiated directly.
There are additional rules for default methods,
    such as Java failing to compile if a class or interface inherits two default methods with the same signature
    and doesnâ€™t provide its own implementation.
If you are a bit out of practice with interfaces, we recommend returning to your
    OCA study material for a full explanation of rules regarding interfaces and method overriding.
