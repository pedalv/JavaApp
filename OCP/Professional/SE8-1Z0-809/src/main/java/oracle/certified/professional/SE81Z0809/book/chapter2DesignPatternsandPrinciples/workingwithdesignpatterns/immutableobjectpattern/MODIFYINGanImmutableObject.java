/*
How do we modify immutable objects if they are inherently unmodifiable?
The answer is, we can’t!
Alternatively, we can create new immutable objects that contain all of the same
    information as the original object plus whatever we wanted to change.
This happens every time we combine two strings:

String firstName = "Grace";
String fullName = firstName + " Hopper";

In this example, the firstName is immutable and is not modified when added to the fullName,
    which is also an immutable object.
We can also do the same thing with our Animal class.
Imagine that we want to increase the age of an Animal by one.
The following creates two Animal instances, the second using a copy of the data from the first instance:
 */
public class MODIFYINGanImmutableObject {


    public static void main(String ... args) {

        // Create a new Animal instance
        AnimalImmutable lion = new AnimalImmutable(
                "lion",
                5,
                Arrays.asList("meat","more meat"));

        // Create a new Animal instance using data from the first instance
        List<String> favoriteFoods = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0; i<lion.getFavoriteFoodsCount(); i++) {
            favoriteFoods.add(lion.getFavoriteFood(i));
        }
        AnimalImmutable updatedLion = new AnimalImmutable(
                lion.getSpecies(),
                lion.getAge()+1,
                favoriteFoods);


        /*
        Since we did not have direct access to the favoriteFoods mutable List,
            we had to copy it using the methods available in the immutable class.
        We could also simplify this by defining a method in Animal that returns a copy of the favoriteFood List,
            provided that the caller understands that modifying this copied List does not change the original Animal
            object in any way.
         */

    }

}
